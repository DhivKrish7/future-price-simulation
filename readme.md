# future-price-simulation

A simple user interactive python program which generates random prices for an asset between 100 - 150 range, and then gives simulations depending on the prices to predict future prices for next 1 year, using Monte Carlo and Geomatric Brownian Motion methods.

## How-to-Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the 'fps.py' file on your terminal
3. Enter the numeric values for price generations, and simulations
4. It gives you the prices generated, mean and sigma for those prices, and future pricing paths (simualtions) and probability distribution 

## Libraries-Used
1. Random
2. Matplotlib
3. Numpy
